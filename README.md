# File encoding and decoding using huffman code algorithm.

Enter the location for any file and it is Encoded!

For Decoding, use huffman_decode.cpp file and you and see your original content of the file.

Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding. The output from Huffman's algorithm can be viewed as a variable-length code table for encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file).
